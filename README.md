# Keylogger

The Keylogger is a tool designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a computer system, capturing user input for analysis or surveillance purposes.

## Introduction

Keylogging, also known as keystroke logging, is the process of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically in a covert manner, to intercept sensitive information such as passwords, usernames, or credit card numbers. The Keylogger tool allows users to monitor and log keystrokes in real-time, providing insights into user behavior and activities.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode:** Operate silently in the background without alerting the user to its presence.
- **Keylogging:** Record keystrokes typed by the user, including text input, passwords, and commands.
- **Screenshot Capture:** Capture screenshots at specified intervals to provide context for recorded keystrokes.
- **Encryption:** Encrypt recorded data to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Access recorded keystrokes remotely for surveillance or analysis purposes.
- **Persistence:** Automatically start and run in the background when the system boots up to ensure continuous monitoring.

## Usage

1. **Installation:** Download and install the Keylogger tool on the target system.
2. **Configuration:** Customize settings such as logging intervals, encryption options, and remote access parameters.
3. **Execution:** Start the Keylogger to begin monitoring and recording keystrokes in the background.
4. **Data Retrieval:** Access recorded keystrokes and screenshots through the provided interface or remote access method.
5. **Analysis:** Analyze captured data to gain insights into user activities and behavior.

## Warning

Keylogging is a sensitive and potentially invasive technique that can infringe on user privacy and security. This tool should only be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring computer usage by authorized users or investigating suspected malicious activity.
